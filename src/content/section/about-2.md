Working at the grassroots level, Sakyadhita provides a communications network among Buddhist women internationally. We promote research and publications on Buddhist women's history and other topics of interest. Our members strive to create equal opportunities for women in all Buddhist traditions. We work to empower the world's 300 million Buddhist women to work for peace and social justice through local branches, the content we offer free of charge online, and through our biannual conferences.

This website provides information on Buddhist women and a forum for sharing research, ideas, and experiences. **Working together Buddhist women are realizing their tremendous potential for social and spiritual transformation!**
