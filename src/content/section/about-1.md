Sakyadhita International Association of Buddhist Women was founded in 1987 in Bodhgaya, India, site of the Buddhaâ€™s awakening. Concerned about the difficulties women faced in various Buddhist traditions, Ayya Khema, Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, and Karma Lekshe Tsomo decided to organize a small gathering to discuss what could be done. At the conclusion of that gathering, participants advocated for the founding of an association to ensure that the conversations would continue and made a conscious decision to form an alliance of both laywomen and monastics. The organization was christened Sakyadhita, Daughters of the Buddha, By establishing and maintaining a communications network among Buddhist women internationally, Sakyadhita has created links among some four hundred million Buddhist women worldwide to encourage and support them in Buddhist practice, scholarship, activism, and the arts.
