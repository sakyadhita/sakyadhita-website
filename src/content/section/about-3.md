Since 1987, Sakyadhita: International Association of Buddhist Women has been working to benefit Buddhist women around the world. Established at the conclusion of the 1st Sakyadhita Conference in Bodhgaya, India, in 1987, the organization has nearly 2,000 members  in 45 countries worldwide.

Laywomen and monastics from around the world come together every two years  to share their experiences and encourage projects that improve conditions for Buddhist women, especially in developing countries.

The 13th Sakyadhita International Conference on Buddhist Women was held in  early  January 2013, in Vaishali, Bihar, India, where the Buddha's aunt/stepmother Mahapajapati Gotami became the first woman to receive ordination.
