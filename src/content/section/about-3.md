Since its founding in 1987, Sakyadhita: International Association of Buddhist Women has been working to benefit Buddhist women in countries around the world. The first international conference on Buddhist women focused on the plight of the nuns, highlighting their marginalization and exclusion from Buddhist institutions, education, and ordination. Since then, Sakyadhita has organized international conferences every two years to celebrate the achievements of Buddhist women. Each conference is historic in its own way. For example, the 13th Sakyadhita Conference in 2013 was held in Vaishali, India, where the Buddha’s aunt/stepmother Mahapajapati Gotami became the first Buddhist nun.

From the very beginning, Sakyadhita members recognized the pressing need for improved educational opportunities for Buddhist women. To that end, they formed committees focused on specific projects and objectives, such as Buddhist scholarship, Buddhist women’s history, translation, social engagement, ordination, publications, and healthcare. For more than three decades now, Buddhist laywomen, laymen, nuns, monks, and their friends from different religions and cultures have come together from all corners of the globe to share their experiences, encourage each other, and inspire projects to improve conditions for Buddhist women, especially in developing countries. With over 5,000 members in 45 countries, Sakyadhita has become a powerful force for good in the world.
