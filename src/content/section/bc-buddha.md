A diversity of Buddhist cultures flourishes around the world. This diversity is reflected in the varied colors of the robes, languages of the chanting, styles of meditation and other practices, the architecture and motifs of the temples, and local social customs. Even after 2,500 years of evolution, the philosophical foundations of these Buddhist cultures are remarkably similar, yet there are many differences among Buddhist cultures. For example, artistic representations of the historical Buddha differ significantly from Sri Lanka to Thailand, Japan, and Tibet. With its commitment to global understanding, Sakyadhita strives to share the riches of Buddhist culture through the lives and work of Buddhist women.
