The 18th Sakyadhita Conference in Seoul, Korea, June 2023 was a deeply moving and inspiring experience. Over 3,000 Buddhist women and well-wishers (5,000 on some days!) from more than 30 countries gathered to share their wisdom, compassion, and joy. Renowned meditation teachers from diverse Buddhist traditions shared their knowledge and experience in three experiential meditation sessions. The exhilarating Opening Ceremony and Cultural Performances led up to a delightful Welcome Reception for participants from around the world. Scholars and practitioners shared their latest research and activism on critical contemporary issues relevant to Buddhist women. In interactive workshops, presenters engaged participants in activities as diverse as Buddhism and Film, Mandala Meditation, Transforming Gender Injustice, Paper Flower Making, to Temple Food, Tai Chi, Tea Meditation, and much more. Evening chanting sessions evoked a sonic festival representing global Buddhist traditions. Focus groups and national branch and chapter gatherings brought participants together with like-minded friends for further collaboration.
