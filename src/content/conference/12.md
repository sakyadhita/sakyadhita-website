The 12th Sakyadhita International Conference on Buddhist Women was held in Bangkok from June 12 to 18, 2011. The conference&apos;s theme was &ldquo;Leading to Liberation,&quot; and a variety of issues were addressed including issues that people don&rsquo;t generally associate with Buddhist women, such as the environment and LGBTQ concerns. The 12th Sakyadhita Conference was hosted at Sathira- Dhammasathan, a learning community founded in central Bangkok in 1987 by Maechee Sansanee Sthirasuta. The center&rsquo;s programs for children, teenagers, parents, and abused women promote peace, harmony, compassion, and enlightenment among people of all ages, genders, and walks of life. The eco-friendly center is home to Savika Sikkahalaya Buddhist Institute, an educational project based on the experiences gained from over 20 years of Sathira Dhammasathan&rsquo;s social services. The center is a delightful and inspiring venue for this historical gathering.
