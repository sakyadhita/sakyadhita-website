The 11th Sakyadhita International Conference on Buddhist Women was held at the Universal Light Monastery in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from December 28, 2009 to January 3, 2010. The conference theme, “Eminent Buddhist Women,” highlighted the achievements of Buddhist Women around the world. Until recently, women were largely absent from Buddhist histories, but since 1987, Sakyadhita members have made conscientious efforts to encourage research on the lives and achievements of both laywomen and nuns in Buddhist societies. The 11th Sakyadhita Conference encouraged further research and reflection on these achievements.
