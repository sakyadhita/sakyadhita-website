The 16th Sakyadhita Confererence, held in the Blue Mountains south of Sydney, Australia, focused on the theme, “New Horizons in Buddhism.” The first Sakyadhita to be held outside of Asia, it drew over 800 people from 29 countries. Featured speakers included leading laywomen, yoginis, nuns, monks, and laymen from around the world. Notable speakers included Roshi Joan Halifax, Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, Bhiksuni Thubten Chodron, Dekila Chungyalpa, Bhikkhu Sujato, Dr. Karma Lekshe Tsomo, and Dr. Paula Arai. Speakers took diverse perspectives on timely and sensitive issues such as conflict resolution in Buddhist countries and communities, sexual misconduct among Buddhist teachers, Dharma and mothering, environmentally friendly Buddhism, and the ongoing debate over the full ordination of women. Films, meditations, Dharma talks, Buddhist music, and workshops on koans, climate crisis, Korean temple food, baby sleepware for unwed mothers, the art of tea, sexual exploitation, death, dance, trauma, kimchee, storytelling, anxiety, Dharma rap, and qigong rounded out the program. The Blue Mountains formed a perfect backdrop for a fascinating gathering.
