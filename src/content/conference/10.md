The 10th Sakyadhita International Conference on Buddhist Women was held at Hotel Mongolia, Ulaanbataar, Mongolia from July 1 to July 5, 2008. The conference theme, &ldquo;Buddhism in Transition: Tradition, Changes, and Challenges,&rdquo; brought together leading Buddhist scholars, practitioners, artists, and social activists from around the world who offered ideas and insights on critical issues facing contemporary society. Morning meditations and evening chanting provided glimpses of the world&rsquo;s rich Buddhist traditions. Small group discussions, interdisciplinary panels, and workshops facilitated dialogue among participants.
