The 14th Sakyadhita Conference was held in Indonesia at the Sambi Resort, located in the highlands on the outskirts of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The tropical ambiance and spacious grounds at Sambi were an ideal setting for meditation, educational presentations, workshops, interactive discussions, and cultural exchanges. As with all Sakyadhita International Conferences, all voices were welcome; women and men lay and ordained of all ages, nationalities, and perspectives.

Over many centuries, Buddhist women have made significant contributions to the spiritual and social well-being of their communities. Nevertheless, Buddhist women are frequently excluded from the processes that shape their communities, such as negotiations among religious, governmental, and social leaders. Decision-makers and social activists may be unfamiliar with Buddhist women&apos;s contributions, while Buddhist women may remain disconnected from the overarching issues that affect their daily lives.

The 14th Sakyadhita International Conference provided an opportunity to discuss creating better connections between Dharma and the social and political dimensions of women&apos;s experience. Together, we explored how compassion and spiritual development can help shape a more just and peaceful world.

Yogyakarta is a city and the capital of Yogyakarta Special Region in Java, Indonesia. It is renowned as a center of classical Javanese fine art and culture such as batik, ballet, drama, music, poetry, and puppet shows. Additionally, Yogyakarta was the center of a refined and sophisticated Javanese Hindu-Buddhist culture for three centuries, beginning in the 8th Century CE. Consequently, there were numerous candi constructed including [Borobudur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur) and [Prambanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prambanan).
