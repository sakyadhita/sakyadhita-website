The conference theme, &ldquo;Buddhism at the Grassroots,&rdquo; highlights the efforts and achievements of Buddhist women who work to alleviate the sufferings of living beings &ldquo;on the ground.&rdquo; Presenters will share their own work and a variety of approaches, including social activism, performance, education, meditation, and philosophy. Since the 1950s, Buddhism has undergone a renewal throughout the world. No longer confined to monasteries and retreat centers, Buddhism is being taught as a practice for everyday living. Until recently, Buddhist women primarily supported the practice of others, but today women are among the most dedicated and diligent practitioners. The 13th Sakyadhita Conference will highlight the achievements of Buddhist women from earliest times until today.
