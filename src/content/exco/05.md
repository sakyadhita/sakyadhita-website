Buphyun Sunim (法炫) was born in Korea. She graduated from college in 1994 and was
ordained as a novice nun in 2005. She received full ordination as a bhiksuni in 2012 and has
completed 12 traditional Korean meditation retreats. Since 2019, she has been studying at the
Graduate School for International Buddhist English at Dongguk University at Gyeongju.

Buphyun Sunim attended her first Sakyadhita International Conference on Buddhist Women
in Australia in 2019. She was greatly inspired by what Sakyadhita offers – an opportunity for
monastics and laywomen to meet and discuss issues to bring about change for a better future.
She would like to participate actively in Sakyadhita and contribute to the process of making a
positive impact.
