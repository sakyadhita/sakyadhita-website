Thich Nu Tien Lien was born in Saigon, Vietnam, in 1966. She enjoyed learning about
Buddhism from a young age. From the age of thirteen, she went to chant sutras every night and
attended Dharma teachings every week. She began living as a Buddhist nun in 1980, received
novice ordination in 1983, and became fully ordained as a bhiksuni in 1985.

In 1991, Thich Nu Tien Lien and her family settled in San Jose, California. There, she lived and
studied with the nuns of Duc Vien Temple. In 1994, she moved to San Diego and, in 1996, she
founded Tinh Xa Ngoc Minh Temple. In 2008, she founded Tinh Xa Ngoc Hoa Temple and, in
2011, the Buddhist Center for World Peace and the International Bhiksuni Buddhist
Congregation, all in San Jose. Over the years, she assisted senior monastics in establishing
temples throughout the United States. She earned a B.A. and a Masterâ€™s in Social Work at San
Diego State University and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Religious Studies at the University of
the West. Venerable Tien Lien is a lifetime member of Sakyadhita and has been active in the
organization since 2004.
