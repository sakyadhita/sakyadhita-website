# Sakyadhita Web Site
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/33b02bdb-9658-4530-9b42-55a1957cb999/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sakyadhita/deploys)

This is the Sakyadhita International static web site created using [Astro](https://astro.build).

The design is based on a previous website written by
[Triton Software Engineering](https://github.com/TritonSE/SI-Website-Revamp)
which was a SERN three tier application (SQL, Express, React, Node). This version
retains the React components but all content has been extracted into Astro
content collections. The backend Express Server and SQL database is no longer
needed.

The website is hosted on Netlify and all form submissions are sent to Netlify.

To create or change content, please place all static content (eg. documents,
images) in `public/content`. A content named `xx` in this directory can be
referenced from elsewhere on the website as absolute URLs beginning
with `/content` eg. `/content/xx`

`src/content` contains all the content contained in the website, eg pages,
conferences, publications, newsletters etc. as Markdown files. Content in
`public/content` can be linked from Markdown files, either within frontmatter or
as embedded links.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
